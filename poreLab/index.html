        The setup: model porous media, solution, syringe, resevoir, LED panel, high pass filter, camera, low pass filter.
        A first step was to do steady flow with one phase. This made it easier to tune parameters. This process involved tuning particle size, 
        viscosity, illumination, filters,  ...

        There are three basic steps for particle velocimetry; Seeding, illumination and imaging. 
        Seeding means preparing a solution with tracing particles for the camera to see. 
        This includes applying surfacant to tracing particles, mixing tracers into some solution, 
        and removing trapped air with an ultrasonic bath. 
        Illumination involves lighting up the particles so that they stand out in the images. 
        We used a LED panel and pass filters in order to strengthen the signal from the particles.
        In addition to pictures of the particles, imaging includes tuning parameters like frame rate,
        shutter speed, and focal length. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeding: For the seeding part, two different fluorescent types of particles were tested. First we tried 30 micron spheres, and
        then we tried 2.5 micron particles. The particles were suspended in a mixture of glycerol and water (and surfacant). Add a "how to make section".
