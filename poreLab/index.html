      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Fluid flows through porous media play a crucial role in various environmental and energy-related processes, 
        influencing everything from groundwater remediation to carbon dioxide sequestration. 
        Porous media, such as soils, river beds, and rocks, serve as conduits for the transportation of molecules, bacteria, and particles. 
        While we have a solid understanding of fluid flows involving a single fluid, such as air or water, 
        predicting simultaneous flows of multiple fluids, like air and water together, remains a challenging task.
      </p>
      <p>
        In light of this challenge, our research project aims to delve deeper into the intricacies of fluid dynamics in porous media. 
        Through a collaborative effort between students and researchers at Porelab and the Njord Centre, we seek to gain new insights 
        by conducting laboratory experiments that explore the behavior of multiple fluids flowing together through porous media.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this, we will employ two cutting-edge methodologies that we have recently developed. 
        The first involves the construction of transparent model porous media using state-of-the-art stereolithography 
        3D printing techniques. By creating these transparent models, we can visualize and better understand the interactions between 
        different fluids within the porous medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second methodology entails the use of laser-based imaging of fluorescent particles to precisely measure and 
        quantify fluid velocities. This technique will enable us to analyze the movements of various fluids as they navigate 
        through the intricate network of porous spaces.

      <h2>Experimental Set-up</h2>
      <p>
        The setup: model porous media, solution, syringe, resevoir, LED panel, high pass filter, camera, low pass filter.
        A first step was to do steady flow with one phase. This made it easier to tune parameters. This process involved tuning particle size, 
        viscosity, illumination, filters,  ...
      </p>
      <p>
        The experimental set-up is shown in figure 1. The model porous media is made of 2 mm cylinders placed symmetrically in a 3D printed
        cell with length ~40 mm, width ~20 mm and height 2 mm. 
        The cylinders were spaced evenly with ~6 mm between them. The fluid was pumped through the porous medium with a constant 
        flow rate using a syringe and a ...  
        The fluid was collected in a resevoir. 
        The fluid was a mixture of glycerol and water respectively accounting for 85% and 15% of the mass of the solution.
        Under the model porous media was a LED panel (which?) with a glass plate seperating them.
        On the LED panel, we put a high pass filter.
        A camera was mounted above the model with a tripod. 
        The camera was a ... 
        A low pass filter was mounted on the camera.

        There are three basic steps for particle velocimetry; Seeding, illumination and imaging. 
        Seeding means preparing a solution with tracing particles for the camera to see. 
        This includes applying surfacant to tracing particles, mixing tracers into some solution, 
        and removing trapped air with an ultrasonic bath. 
        Illumination involves lighting up the particles so that they stand out in the images. 
        We used a LED panel and pass filters in order to strengthen the signal from the particles.
        In addition to pictures of the particles, imaging includes tuning parameters like frame rate,
        shutter speed, and focal length. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the seeding part, two different fluorescent types of particles were tested. 
        The property that seperated them was their size.
        We tried both 30 micron spheres and 2.5 micron spheres.  
        The particles were suspended in the mixture of glycerol and water (and surfacant). 
        Add a "how to make section".

        To illuminate the particle, we shun light at them from a LED panel.
        The producer provides the following emission spectre for the tracing particles (Vis denne figuren!). 
        The panel was covered with a ... high pass filter. 
        This was done in order to dampen the LED panel's frequencies below the excitation band (Skriv om!).
